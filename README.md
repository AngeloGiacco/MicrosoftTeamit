# oundleschoolemail

## Description

a website that reskins Reddit to look like an Oundle School email facility

ðŸš€Uses reddit's API to collect reddit threads

Inspired by [the original reddit reskin by pcottle](http://pcottle.github.io/MSOutlookit/)

## Example

Free tier:
gets access to the retro Outlook version

Paid tier (only Â£10 I know y'all boarders can afford it):
gets access to the modern Outlook version
I'll also customise the pagearound you to make it look more realistic

Exclusive Tier:
I'll completely customise the email around you and reskin any website you choose, doesn't have to be reddit
